# Local Pseudopotentials

This repository contains local pseudopotentials for use with orbital-free density functional theory (for example).

Currently, it holds bulk local pseudopotentials ([BLPSs](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/BLPSLibrary)) and globally-optimized local pseudopotentials ([goLPSs](https://github.com/EACcodes/goLPS)).

Eventually, the individual repositories linked to above will be removed, and this repository will serve as a single, centralized location.
